**NOTE: These drinks showed modest weight loss at best. The researches concluded that these drinks are to be used as an aid to weight loss diets (preferably low-calorie diets), not as a substitute.**

## 1. Green Tea

Even if it’s not for losing weight, green tea is so good for you that &#8220;It&#8217;s the healthiest thing I can think of to drink,&#8221; says Christopher Ochner, PhD. It has such good and proven benefits that Healthline even dubs it as the “healthiest beverage on the planet”

**How it helps you:**

There’s a reason why when you look at the ingredients list for any fat burning supplement, chances are green tea is included.

- Green tea contains catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which in concentrated supplement form has been shown to increase fat oxidation. (**fat burning**) <sup><a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(1</a>, <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10584049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2)</a></sup>
- In one study, it shows that adults who routinely (≥1 time per week) consumed green for more than 10 years have lower body fat percentages and smaller waist circumferences than nonconsumers <sup><a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12972679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(3</a>)</sup>
- Researches also show that green tea reduces body fat&nbsp;<sup>(<a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17557985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>)</sup>&nbsp;,boosts the metabolic rate <sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16840650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a>)</sup>&nbsp;, and increases energy expenditure by 4% <sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10584049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a>)</sup>

## 2. Coffee

Ah, coffee, our favorite psychoactive drug. Before we get into the benefits of coffee, note that this is in no way to justify excessive intake of caffeine. “Moderation is key” as excessive caffeine can lead to unpleasant and even dangerous side effects.&nbsp; By moderate we mean up to 400 mg of caffeine a day (roughly the amount of caffeine in 4 cups of brewed coffee).

**How it helps you:**

- Coffee boosts metabolism by 3-11%, and promotes fat burning&nbsp;<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2912010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>, <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7486839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a>, <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/269/4/E671.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9</a>, <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26189608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815210/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11</a>)</sup>
- Helps reduce energy intake (calorie intake)&nbsp;<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12</a>, <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13</a>)</sup>

## 3. Vegetable Juices & Smoothies

It’s always recommended to incorporate vegetables into your diet and decrease carb intake but not all of us enjoy eating them. Unlike fruit juices (which we like so much) which have been linked to weight gain, vegetable juices seem to be the opposite.&nbsp;<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14</a>)</sup>

We&#8217;ve created a list of the healthiest <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://dietifi.com/best-green-juices/">green juices you can buy</a> or you can DIY with these smoothie recipes.

**How it helps you:**

Research shows that drinking a low-sodium vegetable juice while following a low-calorie diet significantly increases consumption of vegetables while also decreasing carb intake, both important for weight loss. So if you have trouble eating your veggies, try “drinking” them first.&nbsp;<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841082/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15</a>)</sup>

## 4. Water

Drinking water is one of the simplest and natural ways to improve overall health. There is common misconception that increased water intake **directly** facilitates weight loss which is not entirely true. It’s more of an indirect relationship.

**How it helps you:**

- Increases metabolism <sup>(<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/88/12/6015/2661518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16</a>)</sup>
- Suppresses appetite.&nbsp;<sup>(<a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8287852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17</a>)</sup>

  Let’s be honest. Our weight problem mostly stems from overindulgence and overeating. Most of us binge eat and snack every chance we get. That’s why when you get the feeling that you’re hungry again during hours between mealtimes, try drinking water.

- Increase expended energy during rest.

  A study in obese children showed that energy expenditure during rest was increased by up to 25% for 40 minutes after drinking 10 mL of cold water. <sup>(<a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21750519/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18</a>)</sup>

## 5. Oolong Tea

Oolong tea is a semi-fermented tea with its own unique aroma and taste. It has grown in popularity and consumption as indicated by the increasing production due to the fact that it has many health benefits. It undergoes the same withering and oxidation process used to make green teas.

**How it helps you:**

The effects can are similar to green and black tea.

- According to research, included in the many benefits of oolong tea is the stimulation of weight loss from the effects of tea catechins (also found in green tea and black tea. Tea catechins have been shown to increase fat oxidation (burning of fat) <sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19</a>)</sup>
- It decrease body fat content and reduce body weight through improving fat oxidation <sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19271168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20</a>)</sup>

## 6. Whey Protein Drinks

Whey protein is one of the best-studied supplements in the world. You’ve probably seen them usually being sold as a flavoured powder added to protein shakes and protein bars. Studies have proven that it can help you increase your strength, gain muscle, and lose significant amounts of body fat hence their popularity to gym buffs and bodybuilders alike.

**How it helps you:**

- Protein increases levels of hunger-reducing hormones like GLP-1 while decreasing ghrelin, a hormone that drives appetite <sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3851799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12575908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22</a>)</sup>
- Weight loss due to a decrease in body fat without affecting lean body mass&nbsp; <sup>(<a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.20.4.A427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23</a>)</sup>

## 7. Soy Milk

Soy milk is plant-based milk which means its cholesterol free and low in saturated fat (similar to skimmed milk). They are also a great alternative for those who are allergic to dairy or lactose intolerant.

**How it helps you:**

- Researches show that soy milk is as effective as skim milk in promoting weight loss when combined with a low-calorie diet. Recommended intake to optimize the weight loss effects of calcium is 720 mL of either soy milk or skim milk.&nbsp;<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17904943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24</a>)</sup>
