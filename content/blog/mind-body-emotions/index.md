## Mind and Body Relationship

The intimate relationship between the mind (thoughts and feelings) and the body is by no means a new concept. This makes sense since our brain and body share a common &#8220;chemical&#8221; language and are in constant communication with one another.

Below we&#8217;ll discuss how emotions can positively or negatively impact our bodies.

## Is an emotion directly linked to a specific disease?

Unfortunately, if you&#8217;re looking for a formula as in &#8220;anger=diabetes&#8221; or &#8220;gratitude=better eyesight&#8221; then you&#8217;re in no luck.

What scientists can measure, however, is how our body responds to the biochemical reactions that occur from a certain feeling.

The exact mechanics of how the mind and body are linked is still a rocky road and needs further research.

For example:

Although there is a biochemical explanation as to why you&#8217;re face turns red when you get angry, science still cannot explain why those suffering from depression will often experience chest pains, even when there&#8217;s nothing physically wrong with their heart!

## What then are examples of how an emotion affects our health?

### Negative

#### 1. Anger

- Frequent anger is associated with a heightened risk of high blood pressure and heart problems, including heart attack and stroke. <sup><a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591550"  rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>
- Leads to shorter lives.  <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615301167"  rel="nofollow"><sup>2</sup></a> Consistently angry people had 1.57 times the risk of dying early.
- Increases risk of irregular heart rhythm <sup><a style="color: #028dd4;" href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/10/1267.full"  rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>
- Even short intense outbursts of anger has its risks. An individual&#8217;s risk of a heart attack rose nearly five times  in the two hours following an angry outburst (compared to being calm and relaxed) [<sup>4</sup>][1]

#### 2. Work Stress

- 10-40 % increased risk of  coronary heart disease and stroke when exposed to stressors such as job strain and long working hours. <a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238744" rel="nofollow"><sup>5</sup></a>

#### 3. Isolation / Depression / Loneliness

- Linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. <sup style="color: #028dd4;"><a style="color: #028dd4;" href="https://health.usnews.com/health-care/patient-advice/articles/2018-02-14/protecting-your-heart-from-negative-emotions" rel="nofollow">6</a> <a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/13/1009" rel="nofollow">7</a></sup>

### **Did you know?**

One of the most striking examples of how an emotion affects us is a condition known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or **broken-heart syndrome.**

Have you ever noticed that husbands and wives often died within a year of one another?

Emotional events such as the death of a spouse or financial worries severely weakens the heart, which mimics the symptoms of a heart attack.

This emotional burden transforms the heart into a shape that resembles a traditional Japanese pot called a Takotsubo, which has a narrow neck and a wide bottom.
